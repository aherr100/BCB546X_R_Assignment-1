1. Data inspection: well done
2. Data processing:
(files checking)
the results show that you may forget to invert the Position type from character to numeric; there is still 'multiple' existing
```{r}
check1 <- read.csv("./maize_decreasing_1.csv",1)
check1$Chromosome
check1$Position
check2 <- read.csv("./teosinte_increasing_7.csv",1)
check2$Chromosome
check2$Position
```
3. Visualization
i) for the first question, SNP is defined as the ones with variation within group. Your plots actually shows the total number of SNPs with/without variation.
ii) for the second question, the new created variables should be homo/hetero/missing data, but in your plot there is only homo/others, which could be improved. For the sample_ID based plot, we are asked to normalize the y-axis, which you may miss. 
iii) plot for the last question is well done.
